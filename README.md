**Linux Commands**

***Cd***

The Cd command is used to change the current working directory. This is used when you are working with two or more directories and want to toggle between them.

> Vagrant@docker-test:~$ `cd` IS601 

upon this command, we toggle from current directory to IS601 directory.
